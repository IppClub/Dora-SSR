As the Chunjie (Spring Festival) approaches, to welcome the lively and wise Year of the Snake, we have created several illustrations filled with the festive atmosphere of the Spring Festival for the Dora SSR open-source game engine project. These artworks convey our sincere blessings and heartfelt gratitude to all community members.

### Fireworks

Fireworks light up the sky and firecrackers sound, symbolizing renewal and eager anticipation for the future. There are details representing programming languages like C++, Rust, and Lua, signifying our continued exploration of different technological fields in the new year, bringing more surprises and possibilities to Dora SSR.

Reflecting on the past year, we have helped each other and progressed together in the community, allowing Dora SSR to grow from an inspiration into a vibrant and evolving open-source game engine. The participation of every enthusiastic contributor, developer, and player is our driving force. Just like the joyful and lively atmosphere in the illustrations, the new year will also be a brand new journey full of opportunities and challenges.

The **snake** in the Chinese zodiac symbolizes **agility, intelligence, and insight**. Like a nimble and adaptable snake, we will continue to lead the Dora SSR project forward through continuous learning, experimentation, and iteration in the new year.

Here, we sincerely wish everyone in the new year:

1. **Smooth Coding**: May your work, studies, and development processes be more efficient and effective;
2. **Unlimited Creativity**: Whether in game creation or technical research, may you be inspired with endless ideas;
3. **Good Health**: While programming is important, don't forget to maintain a healthy lifestyle;
4. **All the Best**: Enjoy the Spring Festival with family and friends, and gather more beautiful moments.

We sincerely thank every partner for their support and contributions, and we look forward to joining hands again in the new journey of the Year of the Snake in 2025, making Dora SSR even more exciting. Let's unleash our wisdom and passion together, bringing more surprises and emotions to the community.

**Wishing you a prosperous Year of the Snake, happiness for your family, and a joyful Spring Festival!**
