Behind every great creation lies a story filled with magic. The inspiration for Dora SSR stems from one of my favorite childhood tales—*The Wizard of Oz*. In this classic story, young Dorothy and her dog Toto embark on a wondrous and challenging adventure alongside their new friends—the Tin Man who lacks a heart, the Scarecrow who lacks intelligence, and the Cowardly Lion who lacks courage.

The journey of the Dora SSR engine mirrors Dorothy’s experience in *The Wizard of Oz*—a voyage of exploration and discovery. It is not just a technological product but a platform that ignites creativity and brings dreams to life. In this open ecosystem, we yearn for a world of open-source ideals, where everyone can freely contribute and share knowledge within the community. We hope that every developer using Dora SSR will, like Dorothy and her companions, bravely chase their dreams in the realm of game development, overcome obstacles, and discover their true selves.

In the world of Dora SSR, we encourage developers to seek wisdom like the Scarecrow, explore the depths of love like the Tin Man, and find courage like the Lion. Each game represents a new adventure, and every creative idea is an exploration of the unknown. We firmly believe that through this platform, everyone can find their own “Emerald City”—a place where dreams are realized. More importantly, in this open community, every idea and effort is respected and shared, sparking endless possibilities.

The strength of Dora SSR, much like Dorothy and her friends, comes from its ever-growing community—a vibrant environment filled with creativity, support, and collaboration. Our community is our very own “Emerald City,” where everyone can find their voice and place. The open-source philosophy allows every developer to participate, collectively building a better world. We believe that true innovation leaps forward only through openness and cooperation.

Our journey has just begun. Dora SSR will continue to grow and evolve, much like the characters in *The Wizard of Oz*, constantly learning, advancing, and surpassing themselves. We look forward to witnessing more creativity and miracles emerge on this platform and hope to attract like-minded individuals through the power of open source, together writing the chapters of the future.

On this journey, everyone can become Dorothy, and every creative idea has the potential to become the next miracle. In an open world, we dream together and achieve together.
