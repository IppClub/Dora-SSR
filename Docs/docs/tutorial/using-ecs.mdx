# Using the ECS Framework

## 1. Framework Introduction

The ECS (Entity Component System) framework in Dora SSR is inspired by [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas) with some minor modifications in functionality. The basic concepts can be understood using Entitas' principle diagram.

```

```

Unlike Entitas, in the Dora SSR ECS framework, we manage each field on the entity object as a system component. This introduces some additional performance overhead but greatly simplifies the logic code.

## 2. Code Example

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use the ECS (Entity Component System) framework in Dora SSR to develop game logic through a code example.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yue" label="Yuescript">

Before writing the actual code, we require the modules we will use in this tutorial for Yuescript language.

```yue
_ENV = Dora!
```

First, we create two entity groups, `sceneGroup` and `positionGroup`, which are used to access and manage entities with the "scene" and "position" component names, respectively.

```yue
sceneGroup = Group ["scene",]
positionGroup = Group ["position",]
```

Next, we use Observers to listen for changes in entities. Sometimes, you need to perform certain actions when specific components are added to entities. In such cases, you can use Observers to listen for entity addition events and execute corresponding logic when these events occur. Here's an example code snippet on how to use an Observer to listen for entity addition events:

```yue
with Observer "Add", ["scene",]
	\watch (_entity, scene)->
		Director.entry\addChild with scene
			.touchEnabled = true
			\slot "TapEnded", (touch)->
				:location = touch
				positionGroup\each (entity)->
					entity.target = location
```

First, we create an Observer object using the `Observer` class. We specify the event type as "Add" to listen for entity addition events. Additionally, we pass a list containing the string "scene" as the parameter to specify the component types to monitor.

```yue
with Observer "Add", ["scene",]
```

Inside the `watch` method of the Observer object, we define a callback function `(_entity, scene)->`. This callback function is triggered when an entity addition event occurs. The first parameter represents the entity object that triggered the event, followed by the parameters corresponding to the monitored components.

```yue
\watch (_entity, scene)->
```

Within the callback function, we perform a series of operations. First,we use `Director.entry` to add the `scene` to the game scene.

```yue
Director.entry\addChild with scene
```

Next, we set the `touchEnabled` property of the `scene` to `true` to enable touch or tap events.

```yue
.touchEnabled = true
```

Then, we add an event handling function for the "TapEnded" event to the `scene`. This function will be called when the touch event ends.

```yue
\slot "TapEnded", (touch)->
```

Inside the event handling function, we assign the location of the touch to the `location` variable using `:location = touch`.

```yue
:location = touch
```

Finally, we use `positionGroup\each (entity)->` to iterate over all entities in the `positionGroup` and set the `target` property of each entity to the `location`.

```yue
positionGroup\each (entity)->
	entity.target = location
```

In this way, when a new entity with the "scene" component is added, this observer will be triggered, and the defined operations will be executed. The scene node will be added to the game scene, touch events will be enabled, and the target property of entities in the positionGroup will be set to the touch location.

Next, we create additional observers to handle other types of entity changes, such as "Add" and "Remove" events, for the "image" and "sprite" components.

```yue
with Observer "Add", ["image",]
	\watch (image)=> sceneGroup\each (e)->
		with @sprite = Sprite image
			\addTo e.scene
			\runAction Scale 0.5, 0, 0.5, Ease.OutBack
		true

with Observer "Remove", ["sprite",]
	\watch => @oldValues.sprite\removeFromParent!
```

Then, we create an entity group with the components "position", "direction", "speed", and "target". We define an observer to handle changes in these components and update the rotation angle and position properties of the entities based on their speed and the elapsed time.

```yue
with Group ["position", "direction", "speed", "target"]
	\watch (entity, position, direction, speed, target)=>
		return if target == position
		dir = target - position
		dir = dir\normalize!
		newPos = position + dir * speed
		newPos = newPos\clamp position, target
		entity.position = newPos
		entity.target = nil if newPos == target
		angle = math.deg math.atan dir.x, dir.y
		entity.direction = angle
```

In this code snippet, we first create a group object using the `Group` class and specify the component types as "position", "direction", "speed", and "target".

```yue
with Group ["position", "direction", "speed", "target"]
```

Then, we use the `watch` method of the entity group to iterate over all entities in the group every frame and execute the defined callback function to handle the components on each entity.

```yue
\watch (entity, position, direction, speed, target)=>
```

Inside the callback function, we start with some conditional checks. We use `return if target == position` to check if the target position is the same as the current position. If they are the same, we return and skip the update operations.

```yue
return if target == position
```

Next, we calculate the direction vector `dir` of the entity by subtracting the position from the target position and normalize it.

```yue
dir = target - position
dir = dir\normalize!
```

After that, we calculate the new position `newPos` of the entity for the current frame update based on its current position, direction vector, and speed. We multiply the normalized direction vector `dir` by the speed `speed` and add it to the current position `position`.

```yue
newPos = position + dir * speed
```

Then, we use `newPos\clamp position, target` to clamp the new position between the current position and the target position. This ensures that the entity does not overshoot its target position. And assigning the corrected position to entity.

```yue
newPos = newPos\clamp position, target
entity.position = newPos
```

Additionally, if the new position is equal to the target position, we clear the `target` component of the entity.

```yue
entity.target = nil if newPos == target
```

Finally, we calculate the angle `angle` of the entity based on the direction vector `dir` using the `math.atan` function and convert it from radians to degrees. We update the `direction` component of the entity with the calculated angle.

```yue
angle = math.deg math.atan dir.x, dir.y
entity.direction = angle
```

By using this code, the defined callback function will be executed for each entity in the group every frame, updating the rotation angle and position properties based on their speed and target position.

After completing the data calculation and update, we also need to update the data results to the rendered graphics.

```yue
with Observer "AddOrChange", ["position", "direction", "sprite"]
	\watch (position, direction, sprite)=>
		-- Update the display position of the image
		sprite.position = position
		lastDirection = @oldValues.direction or sprite.angle
		-- When the rotation angle of the image changes, we play a rotation animation
		if math.abs(direction - lastDirection) > 1
			sprite\runAction Roll 0.3, lastDirection, direction
```

Lastly, we create three entities and add different components to them. This is where the game system begins to run.

```yue
Entity
	scene: Node!

Entity
	image: "Image/logo.png"
	position: Vec2.zero
	direction: 45.0
	speed: 4.0

Entity
	image: "Image/logo.png"
	position: Vec2 -100, 200
	direction: 90.0
	speed: 10.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tl" label="Teal">

Before writing the actual code, we require the modules we will use in this tutorial for Teal language.

```tl
local Group <const> = require("Group")
local Observer <const> = require("Observer")
local Entity <const> = require("Entity")
local Node <const> = require("Node")
local Director <const> = require("Director")
local Touch <const> = require("Touch")
local Sprite <const> = require("Sprite")
local Scale <const> = require("Scale")
local Ease <const> = require("Ease")
local Vec2 <const> = require("Vec2")
local Roll <const> = require("Roll")
```

First, we create two entity groups, `sceneGroup` and `positionGroup`, which are used to access and manage entities with the "scene" and "position" component names, respectively.

```tl
local sceneGroup = Group {"scene"}
local positionGroup = Group {"position"}
```

Next, we use Observers to listen for changes in entities. Sometimes, you need to perform certain actions when specific components are added to entities. In such cases, you can use Observers to listen for entity addition events and execute corresponding logic when these events occur. Here's an example code snippet on how to use an Observer to listen for entity addition events:

```tl
Observer("Add", {"scene"})
	:watch(function(_entity: Entity.Type, scene: Node.Type)
		Director.entry:addChild(scene)
		scene.touchEnabled = true
		scene:slot("TapEnded", function(touch: Touch.Type)
			local location = touch.location
			positionGroup:each(function(entity: Entity.Type): boolean
				entity.target = location
				return false
			end)
		end)
	end)
```

First, we create an Observer object using the `Observer` class. We specify the event type as "Add" to listen for entity addition events. Additionally, we pass a list containing the string "scene" as the parameter to specify the component types to monitor.

```tl
Observer("Add", {"scene"})
```

Inside the `watch` method of the Observer object, we define a callback function `(_entity, scene)->`. This callback function is triggered when an entity addition event occurs. The first parameter represents the entity object that triggered the event, followed by the parameters corresponding to the monitored components.

```tl
:watch(function(_entity: Entity.Type, scene: Node.Type)
```

Within the callback function, we perform a series of operations. First,we use `Director.entry` to add the `scene` to the game scene.

```tl
Director.entry:addChild(scene)
```

Next, we set the `touchEnabled` property of the `scene` to `true` to enable touch or tap events.

```tl
scene.touchEnabled = true
```

Then, we add an event handling function for the "TapEnded" event to the `scene`. This function will be called when the touch event ends.

```tl
scene:slot("TapEnded", function(touch: Touch.Type)
```

Inside the event handling function, we assign the location of the touch to the `location` variable.

```tl
local location = touch.location
```

Finally, we use `positionGroup:each()` to iterate over all entities in the `positionGroup` and set the `target` property of each entity to the `location`.

```tl
positionGroup:each(function(entity: Entity.Type): boolean
	entity.target = location
	return false
end)
```

In this way, when a new entity with the "scene" component is added, this observer will be triggered, and the defined operations will be executed. The scene node will be added to the game scene, touch events will be enabled, and the target property of entities in the positionGroup will be set to the touch location.

Next, we create additional observers to handle other types of entity changes, such as "Add" and "Remove" events, for the "image" and "sprite" components.

```tl
Observer("Add", {"image"}):watch(function(entity: Entity.Type, image: string)
	sceneGroup:each(function(e: Entity.Type): boolean
		local scene = e.scene as Node.Type
		local sprite = Sprite(image)
		sprite:runAction(Scale(0.5, 0, 0.5, Ease.OutBack))
		sprite:addTo(scene)
		entity.sprite = sprite
		return true
	end)
end)

Observer("Remove", {"sprite"}):watch(function(self: Entity.Type)
	local sprite = self.oldValues.sprite as Node.Type
	sprite:removeFromParent()
end)
```

Then, we create an entity group with the components "position", "direction", "speed", and "target". We define an observer to handle changes in these components and update the rotation angle and position properties of the entities based on their speed and the elapsed time.

```tl
Group({"position", "direction", "speed", "target"}):watch(
	function(entity: Entity.Type, position: Vec2.Type, _direction: number, speed: number, target: Vec2.Type)
	if target == position then
		return
	end
	local dir = target - position
	dir = dir:normalize()
	local newPos = position + dir * speed
	newPos = newPos:clamp(position, target)
	entity.position = newPos
	if newPos == target then
		entity.target = nil
	end
	local angle = math.deg(math.atan(dir.x, dir.y))
	entity.direction = angle
end)
```

In this code snippet, we first create a group object using the `Group` class and specify the component types as "position", "direction", "speed", and "target".

```tl
Group({"position", "direction", "speed", "target"})
```

Then, we use the `watch` method of the entity group to iterate over all entities in the group every frame and execute the defined callback function to handle the components on each entity.

```tl
:watch(
	function(entity: Entity.Type, position: Vec2.Type, _direction: number, speed: number, target: Vec2.Type)
```

Inside the callback function, we start with some conditional checks. We use `return if target == position` to check if the target position is the same as the current position. If they are the same, we return and skip the update operations.

```tl
if target == position then
	return
end
```

Next, we calculate the direction vector `dir` of the entity by subtracting the position from the target position and normalize it.

```tl
local dir = target - position
dir = dir:normalize()
```

After that, we calculate the new position `newPos` of the entity for the current frame update based on its current position, direction vector, and speed. We multiply the normalized direction vector `dir` by the speed `speed` and add it to the current position `position`.

```tl
local newPos = position + dir * speed
```

Then, we use `newPos\clamp position, target` to clamp the new position between the current position and the target position. This ensures that the entity does not overshoot its target position. And assigning the corrected position to entity.

```tl
newPos = newPos:clamp(position, target)
entity.position = newPos
```

Additionally, if the new position is equal to the target position, we clear the `target` component of the entity.

```tl
if newPos == target then
	entity.target = nil
end
```

Finally, we calculate the angle `angle` of the entity based on the direction vector `dir` using the `math.atan` function and convert it from radians to degrees. We update the `direction` component of the entity with the calculated angle.

```tl
local angle = math.deg(math.atan(dir.x, dir.y))
entity.direction = angle
```

By using this code, the defined callback function will be executed for each entity in the group every frame, updating the rotation angle and position properties based on their speed and target position.

After completing the data calculation and update, we also need to update the data results to the rendered graphics.

```tl
Observer("AddOrChange", {"position", "direction", "sprite"})
	:watch(function(entity: Entity.Type, position: Vec2.Type, direction: number, sprite: Sprite.Type)
		-- Update the display position of the image
		sprite.position = position
		local lastDirection = entity.oldValues.direction as number or sprite.angle
		-- When the rotation angle of the image changes, we play a rotation animation
		if math.abs(direction - lastDirection) > 1 then
			sprite:runAction(Roll(0.3, lastDirection, direction))
		end
	end)
```

Lastly, we create three entities and add different components to them. This is where the game system begins to run.

```tl
Entity { scene = Node() }

Entity {
	image = "Image/logo.png",
	position = Vec2.zero,
	direction = 45.0,
	speed = 4.0
}

Entity {
	image = "Image/logo.png",
	position = Vec2(-100, 200),
	direction = 90.0,
	speed = 10.0
}
```

Before writing the actual code, we require the modules we will use in this tutorial for Lua language.

		entity.sprite = sprite
		return true
	end)
end)

Observer("Remove", {"sprite"}):watch(function(entity)
	entity.oldValues.sprite:removeFromParent()

Then, we create an entity group with the components "position", "direction", "speed", and "target". We define an observer to handle changes in these components and update the rotation angle and position properties of the entities based on their speed and the elapsed time.

		if newPos == target then
			entity.target = nil

		local angle = math.deg(math.atan(dir.x, dir.y))
		entity.direction = angle
	end)
```

In this code snippet, we first create a group object using the `Group` class and specify the component types as "position", "direction", "speed", and "target".

```lua

Then, we use the `watch` method of the entity group to iterate over all entities in the group every frame and execute the defined callback function to handle the components on each entity.

This example code demonstrates the basic workflow of using the ECS framework in game development. You can use the provided interfaces of entities, groups, and observers to construct your game logic based on your specific requirements. In the code, you can trigger specific actions based on changes in entity components, perform operations such as adding, removing, or modifying entities and components, and utilize entity groups for grouping and managing entities. By using observers, you can listen for entity change events such as component addition, modification, or removal. In the observer's callback function, you can execute specific logic based on entity changes, such as updating scene nodes, handling user input, or printing debug information.

By organizing the relationships between entities and components effectively and leveraging the listening and processing capabilities of observers, you can build complex game logic and behaviors. In real-world development, you can design and define your own component types based on your game requirements and utilize the provided interfaces of the ECS framework to implement various functionalities and behaviors in your game.

To summarize, the basic workflow of using the Dora SSR ECS framework in game development includes:

1. Defining component types for entities and creating entity objects based on your requirements.
2. Creating entity groups and adding entities to the corresponding groups for grouping and management purposes.
3. Using observers to listen for entity change events, such as component addition, modification, or removal.
4. In the callback functions of entity group observers, performing logic operations based on entity changes every frame.
5. Designing and implementing other components, systems, and functionalities based on your game requirements.

By following the above workflow using the Dora SSR ECS framework, you can better organize and manage your game logic, improve code maintainability and extensibility, and implement complex game features and behaviors.
