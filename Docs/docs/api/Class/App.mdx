**Signature:**
```tl
targetFPS: integer
```

## fpsLimited

**Type:** Field.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Whether the game engine is limiting the frames per second.
Set `fpsLimited` to true, will make engine run in a busy loop to track the  precise frame time to switch to the next frame. And this behavior can lead to 100% CPU usage. This is usually common practice on Windows PCs for better CPU usage occupation. But it also results in extra heat and power consumption.

**Signature:**
```tl
fpsLimited: boolean
```

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Whether the game engine is currently idled.
Set `idled` to true, will make game logic thread use a sleep time and going idled for next frame to come. Due to the imprecision in sleep time. This idled state may cause game engine over slept for a few frames to lost.
`idled` state can reduce some CPU usage.
