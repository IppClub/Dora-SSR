# PhysicsWorld Class

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;A class for creating PhysicsWorld objects.

## scaleFactor

**Type:** Field.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;A factor used for converting physics engine meters value to pixel value.
Default 100.0 is a good value since the physics engine can well simulate real life objects
between 0.1 to 10 meters. Use value 100.0 we can simulate game objects
between 10 to 1000 pixels that suite most games.
You can change this value before any physics body creation.

**Signature:**
```tl
scaleFactor: number
```

## __call

**Type:** Metamethod.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Creates a new "PhysicsWorld" object.

**Signature:**
```tl
metamethod __call: function(self: PhysicsWorldClass): PhysicsWorld
```

**Returns:**

| Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PhysicsWorld | The new "PhysicsWorld" object. |
