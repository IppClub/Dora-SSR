# Dora SSR

&emsp;&emsp;Dora SSR is a game engine for rapid development of 2D games on various devices. It has a built-in easy-to-use development tool chain that supports direct game development on mobile phones, open source handhelds and other devices.

## Key Features

- Manages game scenes based on tree node structure.

- Basic 2D platform game functions, including game logic and AI development framework.

- Easy-to-use ECS module for game entity management.

- Asynchronous processing of file read and write, resource loading and other operations.

- Upgraded Lua binding with support for inheriting and extending low-level C++ objects.

- Supports Yuescript language, strong expressive and concise Lua dialect.

- Supports for the Teal language, a statically typed dialect for Lua.

- Supports TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds powerful type checking.

- Supports TSX, allows embedding XML/HTML-like text within scripts, used with TypeScript.

- Supports the Rust language, running on the built-in WASM runtime with Rust bindings.

- 2D skeletal animation and physics engine support.

- Built-in out-of-the-box Web IDE, providing file management, code inspection, completion, highlighting and definition jump.

- Supports asynchronous operation of SQLite for real-time query and managing large game configuration data.

- Supports reading Excel spreadsheet data and synchronizing it to SQLite tables.

- Supports the Yarn Spinner language, making it easy to write complex game story systems.

## Quick Start

1. Step 1: Create a new project

    - In the browser, open the right-click menu of the game resource tree on the left side of the Dora Dora editor.

    - Click on the menu item `New` and choose to create a new folder named `Hello`.

2. Step 2: Write game code

    - Create a new project in command line.
    
      ```sh
      rustup target add wasm32-wasi
      cargo new hello-dora --name init
      cd hello-dora
      cargo add dora_ssr
      ```
    
    - Write code in `src/main.rs`.
    
      ```rust
      use dora_ssr::*;
      
      fn main () {
        let mut sprite = match Sprite::with_file("Image/logo.png") {
          Some(sprite) => sprite,
          None => return,
        };
        let mut sprite_clone = sprite.clone();
        sprite.schedule(once(move |mut co| async move {
          for i in (1..=3).rev() {
            p!("{}", i);
            sleep!(co, 1.0);
          }
          p!("Hello World");
          sprite_clone.perform_def(ActionDef::sequence(&vec![
            ActionDef::scale(0.1, 1.0, 0.5, EaseType::Linear),
            ActionDef::scale(0.5, 0.5, 1.0, EaseType::OutBack),
          ]));
        }));
      }
      ```
      
    - Build it into WASM file.
    
      ```sh
      cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
      ```
    
    - Upload it to engine to run. From Dora SSR Web IDE, Open the right-click menu of the game resource tree on the created folder `Hello`. Click on the menu item `Upload` and choose the compiled WASM file named `init.wasm` to upload.
    
    - Or use a helper script [upload.py](https://github.com/IppClub/Dora-SSR/blob/main/Tools/dora-rust/dora-test/upload.py) with commad `python3 upload.py "192.168.3.1" "Hello"` inside your Rust project folder to upload WASM file. The IP address is the Dora SSR Web IDE address.
    
3. Step 3: Run the game

    Click the `ðŸŽ®` icon in the lower right corner of the editor, then click the menu item `Run`. Or press the key combination `Ctrl + r`.

4. Step 4: Publish the game

    - Open the right-click menu of the project folder just created through the game resource tree on the left side of the editor and click the `Download` option.

    - Wait for the browser to pop up a download prompt for the packaged project file.
