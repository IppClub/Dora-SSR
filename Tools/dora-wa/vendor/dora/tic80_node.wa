/// # Arguments
///
/// * `cartFile` - The path to the TIC-80 cart file. It should be a valid TIC-80 cart file (`.tic` or `.png` format).
///     The TIC-80 cart file contains the complete game or program that will run in the TIC-80 virtual machine.
///     Supported features:
///       - Full TIC-80 API support (drawing, sound, input, etc.).
///       - Keyboard, controller, and touch input handling.
///       - Audio playback through the TIC-80 sound engine.
///       - Runs at TIC-80's native resolution (240x136 pixels).
///       - Fixed frame rate matching TIC-80's specification (60 FPS).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `TIC80Node` - The created TIC80Node instance. Returns `nil` if creation fails.
