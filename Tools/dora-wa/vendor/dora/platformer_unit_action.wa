/// * `queued` - Whether the "UnitAction" is currently queued or not. The queued "UnitAction" won't replace the running "UnitAction" with a same priority.
/// * `available` - A function that takes a `Unit` object and a `UnitAction` object and returns a boolean value indicating whether the "UnitAction" is available to be performed.
/// * `create` - A function that takes a `Unit` object and a `UnitAction` object and returns a `WasmActionUpdate` object that contains the update function for the "UnitAction".
