/** @brief A face is a combination of sprites and particles.
 When a face is removing, its particles stop emitting and its sprites are all hide.
 And later the entire face is truly removed from memory once it gets totally invisible.  

 Faces can attach to each other just as nodes.

 Faces can be 1 of 6 types:
	Face::Unkown
	Face::Clip
	Face::Image
	Face::Frame
	Face::Particle
	Face::Custom

 Face is just data define, use toNode() method to get visible instance.
