///   or it's the invalid size value indicating that this tree is empty.
/// @invariant The root node's "other" index will be the invalid size value.
/// @invariant Allocated nodes can only be "branch" or "leaf" nodes.
/// @invariant Branch nodes always have two valid "child" nodes.
/// @invariant Branch nodes always have a "height" of 1 plus the maximum height of its children.
/// @invariant Branch nodes' AABBs are always the AABB which minimally encloses its children.
