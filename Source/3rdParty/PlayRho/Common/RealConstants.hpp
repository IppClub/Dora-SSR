///   and casually including it pollutes the name space of all code that uses this library.
///   Whatever the case, MSVC 2017 doesn't make it part of the <code>cmath</code> include
///   without enabling <code>_USE_MATH_DEFINES</code>. So rather than add yet more
///   C preprocessor macros to all sources that this library may be compiled with, it's
///   simply hard-coded in here instead using a C++ mechanism that also keeps it with the
///   enclosing name space.
/// @note Any narrowing is intentional.
