///
/// @brief Classes representing physical entities typically created/destroyed via factory methods.
///
/// @details Classes of creatable and destroyable managed instances that associate
///   physical properties to simulations. These instances are typically created via a
///   method whose name begins with the prefix of <code>Create</code>. Similarly, these
///   instances are typically destroyed using a method whose name begins with the prefix
///   of <code>Destroy</code>.
///
/// @note For example, the following could be used to create a dynamic body having a one meter
///   radius disk shape:
/// @code{.cpp}
/// auto world = World{};

/// @brief Definition of an independent and simulatable "world".
///
/// @details The world class manages physics entities, dynamic simulation, and queries.
///   In a physical sense, perhaps this is more like a universe in that entities in a
///   world have no interaction with entities in other worlds. In any case, there's
///   precedence, from a physics-engine standpoint, for this being called a world.
///
/// @note World instances do not themselves have any force or acceleration properties.
///  They simply utilize the acceleration property of the bodies they manage. This is
///  different than some other engines (like <code>Box2D</code> which provides a world
///  gravity property).
/// @note World instances are composed of &mdash; i.e. contain and own &mdash; Body, Joint,
///   and Contact instances.
/// @note This data structure is 232-bytes large (with 4-byte Real on at least one 64-bit
///   platform).
/// @attention For example, the following could be used to create a dynamic body having a one meter
///   radius disk shape:
/// @code{.cpp}
/// auto world = World{};
