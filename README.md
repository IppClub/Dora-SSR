## Quick Start

1. Step 1: Create a new project

    - In the browser, open the right-click menu of the game resource tree on the left side of the Dora Dora editor.

    - Click on the menu item `New` and choose to create a new folder.

2. Step 2: Write game code

    - Create a new game entry code file of Lua (Yuescript, Teal, Typescript or TSX) under the project folder, named `init`.

    - Write Hello World code:

- **Lua**
```lua
local _ENV = Dora()

local sprite = Sprite("Image/logo.png")
sprite:schedule(once(function()
  for i = 3, 1, -1 do
    print(i)
    sleep(1)
  end
  print("Hello World")
  sprite:perform(Sequence(
    Scale(0.1, 1, 0.5),
    Scale(0.5, 0.5, 1, Ease.OutBack)
  ))
end))
```

- **Teal**
```lua
local sleep <const> = require("sleep")
local Ease <const> = require("Ease")
local Scale <const> = require("Scale")
local Sequence <const> = require("Sequence")
local once <const> = require("once")
local Sprite <const> = require("Sprite")

local sprite = Sprite("Image/logo.png")
if not sprite is nil then
  sprite:schedule(once(function()
    for i = 3, 1, -1 do
      print(i)
      sleep(1)
    end
    print("Hello World")
    sprite:perform(Sequence(
      Scale(0.1, 1, 0.5),
      Scale(0.5, 0.5, 1, Ease.OutBack)
    ))
  end))
end
```
- **Yuescript**
```moonscript
_ENV = Dora!

with Sprite "Image/logo.png"
   \schedule once ->
     for i = 3, 1, -1
       print i
       sleep 1
     print "Hello World!"
     \perform Sequence(
       Scale 0.1, 1, 0.5
       Scale 0.5, 0.5, 1, Ease. OutBack
     )
```
- **Typescript**
```typescript
import {Sprite, Ease, Scale, Sequence, once, sleep} from 'dora';

const sprite = Sprite("Image/logo.png");
if (sprite) {
  sprite.schedule(once(() => {
    for (let i of $range(3, 1, -1)) {
      print(i);
      sleep(1);
    }
    print("Hello World");
    sprite.perform(Sequence(
      Scale(0.1, 1, 0.5),
      Scale(0.5, 0.5, 1, Ease.OutBack)
    ))
  }));
}
```
- **TSX**
```tsx
import { React, toNode, useRef } from 'dora-x';
import { ActionDef, Ease, Sprite, once, sleep } from 'dora';

const actionRef = useRef<ActionDef.Type>();
const spriteRef = useRef<Sprite.Type>();

const onUpdate = once(() => {
  for (let i of $range(3, 1, -1)) {
    print(i);
    sleep(1);
  }
  print("Hello World");
  if (actionRef.current && spriteRef.current) {
    spriteRef.current.perform(actionRef.current);
  }
});

toNode(
  <sprite
    ref={spriteRef}
    file='Image/logo.png'
    onUpdate={onUpdate}
  >
    <action ref={actionRef}>
      <sequence>
        <scale time={0.1} start={1} stop={0.5}/>
        <scale time={0.5} start={0.5} stop={1} easing={Ease.OutBack}/>
      </sequence>
    </action>
  </sprite>
);
```
- Or you can write code in **Rust**, build it into WASM file named `init.wasm`, upload it to engine to run.
```rust
use dora_ssr::*;

fn main () {
  let mut sprite = match Sprite::with_file("Image/logo.png") {
    Some(sprite) => sprite,
    None => return,
  };
  let mut sprite_clone = sprite.clone();
  sprite.schedule(once(move |mut co| async move {
    for i in (1..=3).rev() {
      p!("{}", i);
      sleep!(co, 1.0);
    }
    p!("Hello World");
    sprite_clone.perform_def(ActionDef::sequence(&vec![
      ActionDef::scale(0.1, 1.0, 0.5, EaseType::Linear),
      ActionDef::scale(0.5, 0.5, 1.0, EaseType::OutBack),
    ]));
  }));
}
```

3. Step 3: Run the game

    Click the `üéÆ` icon in the lower right corner of the editor, then click the menu item `Run`. Or press the key combination `Ctrl + r`.

4. Step 4: Publish the game

    - Open the right-click menu of the project folder just created through the game resource tree on the left side of the editor and click the `Download` option.

    - Wait for the browser to pop up a download prompt for the packaged project file.
