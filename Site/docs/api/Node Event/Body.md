# Body Event

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;This is just a demonstration record showing some signal slot events that are used when the receivingContact property of a Body is set to true. And they are meant to be used for collision detection between Body objects.

**Usage:**
```tl
-- you can register for these events using codes
body.receivingContact = true
body:slot("BodyEnter", function(other: Body, sensorTag: integer)
	print("A body enter senser", other, sensorTag)
end)
```

## BodyEnter

**Type:** Node Event.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Triggers when a Body object collides with a sensor object.

**Signature:**
```tl
["BodyEnter"]: function(other: Body, sensorTag: integer)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | Body | The other Body object that the current Body is colliding with. |
| sensorTag | integer | The tag of the sensor that triggered this collision. |

## BodyLeave

**Type:** Node Event.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Triggers when a `Body` object is no longer colliding with a sensor object.

**Signature:**
```tl
["BodyLeave"]: function(other: Body, sensorTag: integer)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | Body | The other `Body` object that the current `Body` is no longer colliding with. |
| sensorTag | integer | The tag of the sensor that triggered this collision. |

## ContactStart

**Type:** Node Event.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Triggers when a `Body` object starts to collide with another object.

**Signature:**
```tl
["ContactStart"]: function(other: Body, point: Vec2, normal: Vec2)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | Body | The other `Body` object that the current `Body` is colliding with. |
| point | Vec2 | The point of collision in world coordinates. |
| normal | Vec2 | The normal vector of the contact surface in world coordinates. |

## ContactEnd

**Type:** Node Event.

**Description:**

&emsp;&emsp;Triggers when a `Body` object stops colliding with another object.

**Signature:**
```tl
["ContactEnd"]: function(other: Body, point: Vec2, normal: Vec2)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | Body | The other `Body` object that the current `Body` is no longer colliding with. |
| point | Vec2 | The point of collision in world coordinates. |
| normal | Vec2 | The normal vector of the contact surface in world coordinates. |
